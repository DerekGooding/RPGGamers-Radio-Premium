RPGGamer-Radio.com is nice for listening to your favourite game music but, like a radio, you have limited control over what you can do. 

This stand alone application gives you some extra functionality without downloading a library of songs. It uses known URLs to make a SQLlite database so at a click, you can play any song. 

Also includes pause and next functions as well as a more reliable volume control.
