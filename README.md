This website is nice for listening to your favourite game music but, like a radio, you have limited control over what you can do. 

This stand alone application gives you some extra functionality without downloading a library of songs. It uses known URLs to make a SQLlite database so at a click, you can play any song. 

Also includes pause and next functions as well as a more reliable volume control. 

## ClickOnce Functionality

If you would like to install this application for personal use: [Setup Link](https://github.com/DerekGooding/RPGGamers-Radio-Premium/raw/main/bin/publish/setup.exe)

Installing with ClickOnce will check for future updates automatically every time you startup the application

Moves Roadmap to a project! Easy viewing and issues!!  [Take a look](https://github.com/users/DerekGooding/projects/3)
