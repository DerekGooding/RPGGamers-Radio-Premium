## RPGGamers-Radio-Premium

http://www.rpgamers.net/radio/

This website is nice for listening to your favourite game music but, like a radio, you have limited control over what you can do. 

This stand alone application gives you some extra functionality without downloading a library of songs. It uses known URLs to make a SQLlite database so at a click, you can play any song. 

Also includes pause and next functions as well as a more reliable volume control. 

## ClickOnce Functionality

If you would like to install this application for personal use: [Setup Link](https://github.com/DerekGooding/RPGGamers-Radio-Premium/raw/main/bin/publish/setup.exe)

Installing with ClickOnce will check for future updates automatically every time you startup the application

## RoadMap

* ~~Add Icons to replace buttons 	and the default application icon.~~
* A custom playlist tab that lets you choose songs to shuffle through
* ~~A timestamp scrubber bar so you can skip to parts of a song you like~~
* Settings tab for saving option preferences | ~~framework~~
* Dark Mode
* ~~A visual representation of the music being played (wave form)~~
* Getting Started tutorial pop-ups for first time users | ~~framework~~
* List the previously played songs for the back button
* Favourites
* And hopefully much more! Please send me ideas


# known bugs planned to be fixed

* ~~After update, doesn't automatically open~~
* Some song text is jumbled/mistranslated
* Play/pause button has no visual to show the music is paused
* The manifest is currently unsigned which prompts a windows warning when installing for the first time
* ~~Updating resets user preferences~~
* waveform doesn't resize with the window
* Waveform doesn't have mouse held functionality
