RPGGamer-Radio.com is nice for listening to your favourite game music but, like a radio, you have limited control over what you can do. 

This stand alone application gives you some extra functionality without downloading a library of songs. It uses known URLs and a simple csv file to target and stream the music. 

Also includes pause and next functions as well as a more reliable volume control. 

More features planned to come! Once installed, click once should keep you up to date with most most recent automatically. 

### Known issue
This no longer uses RPGRadio as the base foundation for this application. To use it, you'll require an API key to be issued specifically from me. There is no other option.
