# RPGGamers-Radio-Premium

http://www.rpgamers.net/radio/

This website is nice for listening to your favourite game music but, like a radio, you have limited control over what you can do. 

This stand alone application gives you some extra functionality without downloading a library of songs. It uses known URLs to make a SQLlite database so at a click, you can play any song. 

Also includes pause and next functions as well as a more reliable volume control. 

# RoadMap

* Add Icons to replace buttons and the default application icon. 
* A custom playlist tab that lets you choose songs to shuffle through
* A timestamp scrubber bar so you can skip to parts of a song you like
* Settings tab for saving option preferences
* Dark Mode
* A visual representation of the music being played (wave form) 
* Getting Started tutorial pop-ups for first time users | For now, just click the next button and enjoy!
* And hopefully much more! Please send me ideas
